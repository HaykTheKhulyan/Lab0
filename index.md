Some of my interests include:

### Favorites

My favorite quote from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is:

> ‘Just get a job?’ Why don’t I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon, and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on jobbies?!

My favorite Python function is the following: 
```
print()
```
